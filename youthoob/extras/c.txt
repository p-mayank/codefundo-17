b"0:00:00.379,0:00:02.292\n- Hey guys, this is Austin.\n\n0:00:02.292,0:00:04.363\nI was literally in the\nmiddle of working on a video\n\n0:00:04.363,0:00:07.237\non hacking when my credit card got hacked.\n\n0:00:07.237,0:00:08.539\nSo, I think this is a great time\n\n0:00:08.539,0:00:10.523\nto talk a little bit about cybersecurity.\n\n0:00:10.523,0:00:13.826\nAnd a huge shoutout to LastPass\nfor sponsoring this video.\n\n0:00:13.826,0:00:14.918\nGreat timing, guys.\n\n0:00:14.918,0:00:16.769\nSo, I've been keeping all\nof my information safe\n\n0:00:16.769,0:00:19.115\nin LastPass for years, way\nbefore they ever reached out\n\n0:00:19.115,0:00:20.488\nand wanted to sponsor a video.\n\n0:00:20.488,0:00:21.590\nI think, like a lot of people,\n\n0:00:21.590,0:00:24.284\nI used to use a couple of\npasswords across all of my sites,\n\n0:00:24.284,0:00:26.623\nwhether that would be for\nTwitter or for my bank account.\n\n0:00:26.623,0:00:28.717\nHowever, with LastPass,\nyou can easily create\n\n0:00:28.717,0:00:30.873\ncompletely custom and random passwords\n\n0:00:30.873,0:00:32.713\nfor each and every individual site\n\n0:00:32.713,0:00:35.071\nand keep them all locked\nup behind a single password\n\n0:00:35.071,0:00:36.368\nin the LastPass Vault.\n\n0:00:36.368,0:00:37.838\nSo, even if one site gets hacked,\n\n0:00:37.838,0:00:40.021\nnone of the rest of your logins\nare going to be vulnerable,\n\n0:00:40.021,0:00:41.964\nand that's available on the free plan.\n\n0:00:41.964,0:00:43.247\nStep up to LastPass Premium,\n\n0:00:43.247,0:00:45.194\nwhich I've had for like four years now,\n\n0:00:45.194,0:00:47.685\nand you get better two-factor\nauthentication options,\n\n0:00:47.685,0:00:49.726\nthe ability to easily\nshare out your logins,\n\n0:00:49.726,0:00:51.044\nand it's only like two bucks a month.\n\n0:00:51.044,0:00:52.593\nBest of all, it works basically across\n\n0:00:52.593,0:00:53.743\nall of your different devices,\n\n0:00:53.743,0:00:56.705\nwhether it be phone,\ntablet, computer, whatever.\n\n0:00:56.705,0:00:58.250\nSo, LastPass is legitimately something\n\n0:00:58.250,0:00:59.800\nthat I use every single day,\n\n0:00:59.800,0:01:00.989\nso if you guys wanna give it a try\n\n0:01:00.989,0:01:02.642\nand help support the channel,\nthe link to check it out\n\n0:01:02.642,0:01:04.280\nwill be in the description of this video.\n\n0:01:04.280,0:01:05.362\nWhen it comes to getting hacked,\n\n0:01:05.362,0:01:07.396\nthere are a lot of ways\nthat it can happen.\n\n0:01:07.396,0:01:08.477\nSo, maybe it's something simple\n\n0:01:08.477,0:01:10.839\nlike you open a fishy email attachment,\n\n0:01:10.839,0:01:11.672\nyou're visiting a site\n\n0:01:11.672,0:01:13.356\nthat you probably shouldn't be looking at.\n\n0:01:13.356,0:01:14.990\nRecently though, these hacks have become\n\n0:01:14.990,0:01:16.592\nmuch, much more ambitious.\n\n0:01:16.592,0:01:18.251\nSo, take for example Equifax.\n\n0:01:18.251,0:01:19.475\nThis is the credit agency\n\n0:01:19.475,0:01:23.108\nthat recently had 143 million\npeople's information leaked.\n\n0:01:23.108,0:01:24.374\nAnd this isn't small stuff\n\n0:01:24.374,0:01:25.961\nlike your phone number or address,\n\n0:01:25.961,0:01:27.563\nthis is really important information\n\n0:01:27.563,0:01:28.795\nlike your Social Security number,\n\n0:01:28.795,0:01:31.491\nwhich makes it very, very easy\nfor identity theft to happen.\n\n0:01:31.491,0:01:33.130\n- With growing fallout this morning\n\n0:01:33.130,0:01:34.662\nover its massive data breach.\n\n0:01:34.662,0:01:37.176\n- The biggest and most significant yet.\n\n0:01:37.176,0:01:41.007\n- Possibly putting 143\nmillion Americans at risk.\n\n0:01:41.007,0:01:42.744\n- So, back in March, a major vulnerability\n\n0:01:42.744,0:01:44.575\nwas found in Equifax's backend\n\n0:01:44.575,0:01:46.823\nand it wasn't fixed until the end of July,\n\n0:01:46.823,0:01:47.783\nmeaning that for months\n\n0:01:47.783,0:01:50.178\nabout one-third of the US\npopulation's information\n\n0:01:50.178,0:01:51.525\nwas wide open for the taking.\n\n0:01:51.525,0:01:53.496\nThis is hardly an isolated incident.\n\n0:01:53.496,0:01:55.529\nSo, only a few weeks\nafter the Equifax hack,\n\n0:01:55.529,0:01:57.615\nCCleaner had their own issues.\n\n0:01:57.615,0:01:59.850\nSo, CCleaner is a very popular utility\n\n0:01:59.850,0:02:01.664\nto allow you to clean your computer.\n\n0:02:01.664,0:02:03.251\nHowever, for a short time,\n\n0:02:03.251,0:02:04.771\nthe legitimate version was replaced\n\n0:02:04.771,0:02:06.284\nthat you downloaded from their site\n\n0:02:06.284,0:02:07.936\nwith a version that was\nloaded with malware.\n\n0:02:07.936,0:02:09.132\nThe scary part of this is\n\n0:02:09.132,0:02:11.084\nis that there was actually\nno real way of telling\n\n0:02:11.084,0:02:13.114\nthat what you were downloading\nwas actually malware\n\n0:02:13.114,0:02:14.819\nand not the proper program.\n\n0:02:14.819,0:02:17.112\nYou're going to the official\nsite, you're downloading it,\n\n0:02:17.112,0:02:19.340\ninstalling it, everything\nlooks completely legit\n\n0:02:19.340,0:02:20.656\nand the program even works.\n\n0:02:20.656,0:02:23.847\nHowever, in the background\nwas a serious virus.\n\n0:02:23.847,0:02:25.796\nSo, the popular DVD ripping tool HandBrake\n\n0:02:25.796,0:02:27.546\nhad a very similar thing happen.\n\n0:02:27.546,0:02:29.142\nFor a period of four days,\n\n0:02:29.142,0:02:31.217\nthe legitimate download\nwas replaced with a version\n\n0:02:31.217,0:02:33.965\nthat had a Mac-specific version\nof malware inside of it.\n\n0:02:33.965,0:02:35.061\nEven worse is that hacks\n\n0:02:35.061,0:02:37.091\nare no longer confined to just software;\n\n0:02:37.091,0:02:39.283\nthey're hitting close to home, literally.\n\n0:02:39.283,0:02:41.332\nWith products like Amazon\nEcho and Google Home\n\n0:02:41.332,0:02:43.189\nbeing brought into more\nand more households,\n\n0:02:43.189,0:02:45.017\nthese companies are\ngetting closer and closer\n\n0:02:45.017,0:02:46.758\nto our personal lives than ever before.\n\n0:02:46.758,0:02:48.438\nNow, this can be a good thing.\n\n0:02:48.438,0:02:50.122\nSo, it's nice to be able\nto walk into your house\n\n0:02:50.122,0:02:52.190\nand tell Alexa to turn the lights on.\n\n0:02:52.190,0:02:54.000\nMaybe if you forget to look\nyour door when you leave,\n\n0:02:54.000,0:02:55.199\nyou can just do it\nstraight from your phone\n\n0:02:55.199,0:02:56.288\nwith a smart lock.\n\n0:02:56.288,0:02:57.694\nAnd stuff like Nest security cameras\n\n0:02:57.694,0:02:59.305\nwill give you a much\nbetter sense of security\n\n0:02:59.305,0:03:01.807\nwhen you can see exactly what's\ngoing on inside your house.\n\n0:03:01.807,0:03:03.229\nBut like all good things in life,\n\n0:03:03.229,0:03:05.403\nit doesn't exactly work all the time.\n\n0:03:05.403,0:03:06.495\nAnd like a lot of people fear\n\n0:03:06.495,0:03:08.676\nwhen stuff like the Amazon\nEcho first came out,\n\n0:03:08.676,0:03:10.432\nthere is a way to now hack this.\n\n0:03:10.432,0:03:11.920\nIf you peel back the little rubber pad\n\n0:03:11.920,0:03:13.306\non the bottom of an Amazon Echo,\n\n0:03:13.306,0:03:15.227\nyou'll see a series of contacts.\n\n0:03:15.227,0:03:16.153\nSo, using these,\n\n0:03:16.153,0:03:17.356\nif you have a little bit\nof technical knowledge\n\n0:03:17.356,0:03:19.882\nand about 10 minutes, you can\nactually turn an Amazon Echo\n\n0:03:19.882,0:03:21.115\ninto a listening device.\n\n0:03:21.115,0:03:21.948\nThe upside is,\n\n0:03:21.948,0:03:24.072\nas long as you don't have\na super-nerd as an enemy,\n\n0:03:24.072,0:03:25.924\nthis is not an easy hack to pull off.\n\n0:03:25.924,0:03:27.749\nNot only do you need\nthat technical knowledge\n\n0:03:27.749,0:03:31.074\nbut you also need to have actual\naccess to the Echo in-hand.\n\n0:03:31.074,0:03:31.939\nAnd to Amazon's credit,\n\n0:03:31.939,0:03:33.543\nthey actually have\nremoved this vulnerability\n\n0:03:33.543,0:03:34.795\nfrom the most recent model.\n\n0:03:34.795,0:03:35.684\nThe real issue here\n\n0:03:35.684,0:03:37.622\nis when there's an Echo in a public place.\n\n0:03:37.622,0:03:39.907\nSo, take for example the\nWynn hotel in Las Vegas.\n\n0:03:39.907,0:03:41.657\nThey have an Echo in every single room,\n\n0:03:41.657,0:03:43.311\nand all it takes is for\nsomeone to hack it once\n\n0:03:43.311,0:03:44.818\nand they can listen in\nto the conversations\n\n0:03:44.818,0:03:46.402\nin that room pretty much forever.\n\n0:03:46.402,0:03:49.307\nAll right, so what can you\nactually do about this?\n\n0:03:49.307,0:03:50.582\nWell, the first thing to understand\n\n0:03:50.582,0:03:51.848\nis that there's no way of keeping you\n\n0:03:51.848,0:03:53.591\nand your data completely safe.\n\n0:03:53.591,0:03:55.578\nIf you applied for a\ncredit card five years ago\n\n0:03:55.578,0:03:58.012\nand the credit agency\ngets hacked, too bad.\n\n0:03:58.012,0:03:59.219\nI'm probably never going to know\n\n0:03:59.219,0:04:01.281\nhow my credit card got compromised.\n\n0:04:01.281,0:04:02.424\nIt could've been something simple\n\n0:04:02.424,0:04:04.840\nlike being skimmed at\nan ATM or gas station\n\n0:04:04.840,0:04:06.975\nor maybe some site that I\nused the card on was hacked\n\n0:04:06.975,0:04:08.289\nand I just didn't know it.\n\n0:04:08.289,0:04:09.581\nBut there are some things you can do\n\n0:04:09.581,0:04:10.671\nto help protect yourself.\n\n0:04:10.671,0:04:13.100\nThe easiest thing is to\njust check your credit.\n\n0:04:13.100,0:04:15.105\nSo, if you live in the\nUS, federal law guarantees\n\n0:04:15.105,0:04:16.725\nthat you can get one free credit report\n\n0:04:16.725,0:04:18.943\nfrom each of the three\nmajor agencies per year.\n\n0:04:18.943,0:04:20.581\nOn the digital front,\nit makes sense to have\n\n0:04:20.581,0:04:24.012\nsome kind of antivirus and\nkeep your devices up-to-date.\n\n0:04:24.012,0:04:25.585\nSo, that includes those Windows updates\n\n0:04:25.585,0:04:27.899\nthat you've been saying no\nto for the last six months\n\n0:04:27.899,0:04:30.026\nor you keep your browser\nup to date, your phone;\n\n0:04:30.026,0:04:32.395\nall of these things are constantly\ngetting security updates\n\n0:04:32.395,0:04:34.515\nand they can really save you\nwhen these things come up.\n\n0:04:34.515,0:04:36.326\nThreats like this are\nnever going to go away.\n\n0:04:36.326,0:04:38.260\nBut as long as you're smart\nand keep an eye on things,\n\n0:04:38.260,0:04:39.877\nthen you should be fine.\n\n0:04:39.877,0:04:42.323\nSo, have you actually ever\ngotten hacked yourself?\n\n0:04:42.323,0:04:43.555\nLet me know in the comments below,\n\n0:04:43.555,0:04:45.230\nand I will catch you in the next one.\n\n"

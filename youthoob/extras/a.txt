Austin.</p>\n<p begin="00:00:02.292" end="00:00:04.363" style="s2">I was literally in the<br />middle of working on a video</p>\n<p begin="00:00:04.363" end="00:00:07.237" style="s2">on hacking when my credit card got hacked.</p>\n<p begin="00:00:07.237" end="00:00:08.539" style="s2">So, I think this is a great time</p>\n<p begin="00:00:08.539" end="00:00:10.523" style="s2">to talk a little bit about cybersecurity.</p>\n<p begin="00:00:10.523" end="00:00:13.826" style="s2">And a huge shoutout to LastPass<br />for sponsoring this video.</p>\n<p begin="00:00:13.826" end="00:00:14.918" style="s2">Great timing, guys.</p>\n<p begin="00:00:14.918" end="00:00:16.769" style="s2">So, I&#39;ve been keeping all<br />of my information safe</p>\n<p begin="00:00:16.769" end="00:00:19.115" style="s2">in LastPass for years, way<br />before they ever reached out</p>\n<p begin="00:00:19.115" end="00:00:20.488" style="s2">and wanted to sponsor a video.</p>\n<p begin="00:00:20.488" end="00:00:21.590" style="s2">I think, like a lot of people,</p>\n<p begin="00:00:21.590" end="00:00:24.284" style="s2">I used to use a couple of<br />passwords across all of my sites,</p>\n<p begin="00:00:24.284" end="00:00:26.623" style="s2">whether that would be for<br />Twitter or for my bank account.</p>\n<p begin="00:00:26.623" end="00:00:28.717" style="s2">However, with LastPass,<br />you can easily create</p>\n<p begin="00:00:28.717" end="00:00:30.873" style="s2">completely custom and random passwords</p>\n<p begin="00:00:30.873" end="00:00:32.713" style="s2">for each and every individual site</p>\n<p begin="00:00:32.713" end="00:00:35.071" style="s2">and keep them all locked<br />up behind a single password</p>\n<p begin="00:00:35.071" end="00:00:36.368" style="s2">in the LastPass Vault.</p>\n<p begin="00:00:36.368" end="00:00:37.838" style="s2">So, even if one site gets hacked,</p>\n<p begin="00:00:37.838" end="00:00:40.021" style="s2">none of the rest of your logins<br />are going to be vulnerable,</p>\n<p begin="00:00:40.021" end="00:00:41.964" style="s2">and that&#39;s available on the free plan.</p>\n<p begin="00:00:41.964" end="00:00:43.247" style="s2">Step up to LastPass Premium,</p>\n<p begin="00:00:43.247" end="00:00:45.194" style="s2">which I&#39;ve had for like four years now,</p>\n<p begin="00:00:45.194" end="00:00:47.685" style="s2">and you get better two-factor<br />authentication options,</p>\n<p begin="00:00:47.685" end="00:00:49.726" style="s2">the ability to easily<br />share out your logins,</p>\n<p begin="00:00:49.726" end="00:00:51.044" style="s2">and it&#39;s only like two bucks a month.</p>\n<p begin="00:00:51.044" end="00:00:52.593" style="s2">Best of all, it works basically across</p>\n<p begin="00:00:52.593" end="00:00:53.743" style="s2">all of your different devices,</p>\n<p begin="00:00:53.743" end="00:00:56.705" style="s2">whether it be phone,<br />tablet, computer, whatever.</p>\n<p begin="00:00:56.705" end="00:00:58.250" style="s2">So, LastPass is legitimately something</p>\n<p begin="00:00:58.250" end="00:00:59.800" style="s2">that I use every single day,</p>\n<p begin="00:00:59.800" end="00:01:00.989" style="s2">so if you guys wanna give it a try</p>\n<p begin="00:01:00.989" end="00:01:02.642" style="s2">and help support the channel,<br />the link to check it out</p>\n<p begin="00:01:02.642" end="00:01:04.280" style="s2">will be in the description of this video.</p>\n<p begin="00:01:04.280" end="00:01:05.362" style="s2">When it comes to getting hacked,</p>\n<p begin="00:01:05.362" end="00:01:07.396" style="s2">there are a lot of ways<br />that it can happen.</p>\n<p begin="00:01:07.396" end="00:01:08.477" style="s2">So, maybe it&#39;s something simple</p>\n<p begin="00:01:08.477" end="00:01:10.839" style="s2">like you open a fishy email attachment,</p>\n<p begin="00:01:10.839" end="00:01:11.672" style="s2">you&#39;re visiting a site</p>\n<p begin="00:01:11.672" end="00:01:13.356" style="s2">that you probably shouldn&#39;t be looking at.</p>\n<p begin="00:01:13.356" end="00:01:14.990" style="s2">Recently though, these hacks have become</p>\n<p begin="00:01:14.990" end="00:01:16.592" style="s2">much, much more ambitious.</p>\n<p begin="00:01:16.592" end="00:01:18.251" style="s2">So, take for example Equifax.</p>\n<p begin="00:01:18.251" end="00:01:19.475" style="s2">This is the credit agency</p>\n<p begin="00:01:19.475" end="00:01:23.108" style="s2">that recently had 143 million<br />people&#39;s information leaked.</p>\n<p begin="00:01:23.108" end="00:01:24.374" style="s2">And this isn&#39;t small stuff</p>\n<p begin="00:01:24.374" end="00:01:25.961" style="s2">like your phone number or address,</p>\n<p begin="00:01:25.961" end="00:01:27.563" style="s2">this is really important information</p>\n<p begin="00:01:27.563" end="00:01:28.795" style="s2">like your Social Security number,</p>\n<p begin="00:01:28.795" end="00:01:31.491" style="s2">which makes it very, very easy<br />for identity theft to happen.</p>\n<p begin="00:01:31.491" end="00:01:33.130" style="s2">- With growing fallout this morning</p>\n<p begin="00:01:33.130" end="00:01:34.662" style="s2">over its massive data breach.</p>\n<p begin="00:01:34.662" end="00:01:37.176" style="s2">- The biggest and most significant yet.</p>\n<p begin="00:01:37.176" end="00:01:41.007" style="s2">- Possibly putting 143<br />million Americans at risk.</p>\n<p begin="00:01:41.007" end="00:01:42.744" style="s2">- So, back in March, a major vulnerability</p>\n<p begin="00:01:42.744" end="00:01:44.575" style="s2">was found in Equifax&#39;s backend</p>\n<p begin="00:01:44.575" end="00:01:46.823" style="s2">and it wasn&#39;t fixed until the end of July,</p>\n<p begin="00:01:46.823" end="00:01:47.783" style="s2">meaning that for months</p>\n<p begin="00:01:47.783" end="00:01:50.178" style="s2">about one-third of the US<br />population&#39;s information</p>\n<p begin="00:01:50.178" end="00:01:51.525" style="s2">was wide open for the taking.</p>\n<p begin="00:01:51.525" end="00:01:53.496" style="s2">This is hardly an isolated incident.</p>\n<p begin="00:01:53.496" end="00:01:55.529" style="s2">So, only a few weeks<br />after the Equifax hack,</p>\n<p begin="00:01:55.529" end="00:01:57.615" style="s2">CCleaner had their own issues.</p>\n<p begin="00:01:57.615" end="00:01:59.850" style="s2">So, CCleaner is a very popular utility</p>\n<p begin="00:01:59.850" end="00:02:01.664" style="s2">to allow you to clean your computer.</p>\n<p begin="00:02:01.664" end="00:02:03.251" style="s2">However, for a short time,</p>\n<p begin="00:02:03.251" end="00:02:04.771" style="s2">the legitimate version was replaced</p>\n<p begin="00:02:04.771" end="00:02:06.284" style="s2">that you downloaded from their site</p>\n<p begin="00:02:06.284" end="00:02:07.936" style="s2">with a version that was<br />loaded with malware.</p>\n<p begin="00:02:07.936" end="00:02:09.132" style="s2">The scary part of this is</p>\n<p begin="00:02:09.132" end="00:02:11.084" style="s2">is that there was actually<br />no real way of telling</p>\n<p begin="00:02:11.084" end="00:02:13.114" style="s2">that what you were downloading<br />was actually malware</p>\n<p begin="00:02:13.114" end="00:02:14.819" style="s2">and not the proper program.</p>\n<p begin="00:02:14.819" end="00:02:17.112" style="s2">You&#39;re going to the official<br />site, you&#39;re downloading it,</p>\n<p begin="00:02:17.112" end="00:02:19.340" style="s2">installing it, everything<br />looks completely legit</p>\n<p begin="00:02:19.340" end="00:02:20.656" style="s2">and the program even works.</p>\n<p begin="00:02:20.656" end="00:02:23.847" style="s2">However, in the background<br />was a serious virus.</p>\n<p begin="00:02:23.847" end="00:02:25.796" style="s2">So, the popular DVD ripping tool HandBrake</p>\n<p begin="00:02:25.796" end="00:02:27.546" style="s2">had a very similar thing happen.</p>\n<p begin="00:02:27.546" end="00:02:29.142" style="s2">For a period of four days,</p>\n<p begin="00:02:29.142" end="00:02:31.217" style="s2">the legitimate download<br />was replaced with a version</p>\n<p begin="00:02:31.217" end="00:02:33.965" style="s2">that had a Mac-specific version<br />of malware inside of it.</p>\n<p begin="00:02:33.965" end="00:02:35.061" style="s2">Even worse is that hacks</p>\n<p begin="00:02:35.061" end="00:02:37.091" style="s2">are no longer confined to just software;</p>\n<p begin="00:02:37.091" end="00:02:39.283" style="s2">they&#39;re hitting close to home, literally.</p>\n<p begin="00:02:39.283" end="00:02:41.332" style="s2">With products like Amazon<br />Echo and Google Home</p>\n<p begin="00:02:41.332" end="00:02:43.189" style="s2">being brought into more<br />and more households,</p>\n<p begin="00:02:43.189" end="00:02:45.017" style="s2">these companies are<br />getting closer and closer</p>\n<p begin="00:02:45.017" end="00:02:46.758" style="s2">to our personal lives than ever before.</p>\n<p begin="00:02:46.758" end="00:02:48.438" style="s2">Now, this can be a good thing.</p>\n<p begin="00:02:48.438" end="00:02:50.122" style="s2">So, it&#39;s nice to be able<br />to walk into your house</p>\n<p begin="00:02:50.122" end="00:02:52.190" style="s2">and tell Alexa to turn the lights on.</p>\n<p begin="00:02:52.190" end="00:02:54.000" style="s2">Maybe if you forget to look<br />your door when you leave,</p>\n<p begin="00:02:54.000" end="00:02:55.199" style="s2">you can just do it<br />straight from your phone</p>\n<p begin="00:02:55.199" end="00:02:56.288" style="s2">with a smart lock.</p>\n<p begin="00:02:56.288" end="00:02:57.694" style="s2">And stuff like Nest security cameras</p>\n<p begin="00:02:57.694" end="00:02:59.305" style="s2">will give you a much<br />better sense of security</p>\n<p begin="00:02:59.305" end="00:03:01.807" style="s2">when you can see exactly what&#39;s<br />going on inside your house.</p>\n<p begin="00:03:01.807" end="00:03:03.229" style="s2">But like all good things in life,</p>\n<p begin="00:03:03.229" end="00:03:05.403" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t exactly work all the time.</p>\n<p begin="00:03:05.403" end="00:03:06.495" style="s2">And like a lot of people fear</p>\n<p begin="00:03:06.495" end="00:03:08.676" style="s2">when stuff like the Amazon<br />Echo first came out,</p>\n<p begin="00:03:08.676" end="00:03:10.432" style="s2">there is a way to now hack this.</p>\n<p begin="00:03:10.432" end="00:03:11.920" style="s2">If you peel back the little rubber pad</p>\n<p begin="00:03:11.920" end="00:03:13.306" style="s2">on the bottom of an Amazon Echo,</p>\n<p begin="00:03:13.306" end="00:03:15.227" style="s2">you&#39;ll see a series of contacts.</p>\n<p begin="00:03:15.227" end="00:03:16.153" style="s2">So, using these,</p>\n<p begin="00:03:16.153" end="00:03:17.356" style="s2">if you have a little bit<br />of technical knowledge</p>\n<p begin="00:03:17.356" end="00:03:19.882" style="s2">and about 10 minutes, you can<br />actually turn an Amazon Echo</p>\n<p begin="00:03:19.882" end="00:03:21.115" style="s2">into a listening device.</p>\n<p begin="00:03:21.115" end="00:03:21.948" style="s2">The upside is,</p>\n<p begin="00:03:21.948" end="00:03:24.072" style="s2">as long as you don&#39;t have<br />a super-nerd as an enemy,</p>\n<p begin="00:03:24.072" end="00:03:25.924" style="s2">this is not an easy hack to pull off.</p>\n<p begin="00:03:25.924" end="00:03:27.749" style="s2">Not only do you need<br />that technical knowledge</p>\n<p begin="00:03:27.749" end="00:03:31.074" style="s2">but you also need to have actual<br />access to the Echo in-hand.</p>\n<p begin="00:03:31.074" end="00:03:31.939" style="s2">And to Amazon&#39;s credit,</p>\n<p begin="00:03:31.939" end="00:03:33.543" style="s2">they actually have<br />removed this vulnerability</p>\n<p begin="00:03:33.543" end="00:03:34.795" style="s2">from the most recent model.</p>\n<p begin="00:03:34.795" end="00:03:35.684" style="s2">The real issue here</p>\n<p begin="00:03:35.684" end="00:03:37.622" style="s2">is when there&#39;s an Echo in a public place.</p>\n<p begin="00:03:37.622" end="00:03:39.907" style="s2">So, take for example the<br />Wynn hotel in Las Vegas.</p>\n<p begin="00:03:39.907" end="00:03:41.657" style="s2">They have an Echo in every single room,</p>\n<p begin="00:03:41.657" end="00:03:43.311" style="s2">and all it takes is for<br />someone to hack it once</p>\n<p begin="00:03:43.311" end="00:03:44.818" style="s2">and they can listen in<br />to the conversations</p>\n<p begin="00:03:44.818" end="00:03:46.402" style="s2">in that room pretty much forever.</p>\n<p begin="00:03:46.402" end="00:03:49.307" style="s2">All right, so what can you<br />actually do about this?</p>\n<p begin="00:03:49.307" end="00:03:50.582" style="s2">Well, the first thing to understand</p>\n<p begin="00:03:50.582" end="00:03:51.848" style="s2">is that there&#39;s no way of keeping you</p>\n<p begin="00:03:51.848" end="00:03:53.591" style="s2">and your data completely safe.</p>\n<p begin="00:03:53.591" end="00:03:55.578" style="s2">If you applied for a<br />credit card five years ago</p>\n<p begin="00:03:55.578" end="00:03:58.012" style="s2">and the credit agency<br />gets hacked, too bad.</p>\n<p begin="00:03:58.012" end="00:03:59.219" style="s2">I&#39;m probably never going to know</p>\n<p begin="00:03:59.219" end="00:04:01.281" style="s2">how my credit card got compromised.</p>\n<p begin="00:04:01.281" end="00:04:02.424" style="s2">It could&#39;ve been something simple</p>\n<p begin="00:04:02.424" end="00:04:04.840" style="s2">like being skimmed at<br />an ATM or gas station</p>\n<p begin="00:04:04.840" end="00:04:06.975" style="s2">or maybe some site that I<br />used the card on was hacked</p>\n<p begin="00:04:06.975" end="00:04:08.289" style="s2">and I just didn&#39;t know it.</p>\n<p begin="00:04:08.289" end="00:04:09.581" style="s2">But there are some things you can do</p>\n<p begin="00:04:09.581" end="00:04:10.671" style="s2">to help protect yourself.</p>\n<p begin="00:04:10.671" end="00:04:13.100" style="s2">The easiest thing is to<br />just check your credit.</p>\n<p begin="00:04:13.100" end="00:04:15.105" style="s2">So, if you live in the<br />US, federal law guarantees</p>\n<p begin="00:04:15.105" end="00:04:16.725" style="s2">that you can get one free credit report</p>\n<p begin="00:04:16.725" end="00:04:18.943" style="s2">from each of the three<br />major agencies per year.</p>\n<p begin="00:04:18.943" end="00:04:20.581" style="s2">On the digital front,<br />it makes sense to have</p>\n<p begin="00:04:20.581" end="00:04:24.012" style="s2">some kind of antivirus and<br />keep your devices up-to-date.</p>\n<p begin="00:04:24.012" end="00:04:25.585" style="s2">So, that includes those Windows updates</p>\n<p begin="00:04:25.585" end="00:04:27.899" style="s2">that you&#39;ve been saying no<br />to for the last six months</p>\n<p begin="00:04:27.899" end="00:04:30.026" style="s2">or you keep your browser<br />up to date, your phone;</p>\n<p begin="00:04:30.026" end="00:04:32.395" style="s2">all of these

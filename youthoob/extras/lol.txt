b"1\n00:00:00,379 --> 00:00:02,292\n- Hey guys, this is Austin.\n\n2\n00:00:02,292 --> 00:00:04,363\nI was literally in the\nmiddle of working on a video\n\n3\n00:00:04,363 --> 00:00:07,237\non hacking when my credit card got hacked.\n\n4\n00:00:07,237 --> 00:00:08,539\nSo, I think this is a great time\n\n5\n00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:10,523\nto talk a little bit about cybersecurity.\n\n6\n00:00:10,523 --> 00:00:13,826\nAnd a huge shoutout to LastPass\nfor sponsoring this video.\n\n7\n00:00:13,826 --> 00:00:14,918\nGreat timing, guys.\n\n8\n00:00:14,918 --> 00:00:16,769\nSo, I've been keeping all\nof my information safe\n\n9\n00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:19,115\nin LastPass for years, way\nbefore they ever reached out\n\n10\n00:00:19,115 --> 00:00:20,488\nand wanted to sponsor a video.\n\n11\n00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:21,590\nI think, like a lot of people,\n\n12\n00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,284\nI used to use a couple of\npasswords across all of my sites,\n\n13\n00:00:24,284 --> 00:00:26,623\nwhether that would be for\nTwitter or for my bank account.\n\n14\n00:00:26,623 --> 00:00:28,717\nHowever, with LastPass,\nyou can easily create\n\n15\n00:00:28,717 --> 00:00:30,873\ncompletely custom and random passwords\n\n16\n00:00:30,873 --> 00:00:32,713\nfor each and every individual site\n\n17\n00:00:32,713 --> 00:00:35,071\nand keep them all locked\nup behind a single password\n\n18\n00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:36,368\nin the LastPass Vault.\n\n19\n00:00:36,368 --> 00:00:37,838\nSo, even if one site gets hacked,\n\n20\n00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:40,021\nnone of the rest of your logins\nare going to be vulnerable,\n\n21\n00:00:40,021 --> 00:00:41,964\nand that's available on the free plan.\n\n22\n00:00:41,964 --> 00:00:43,247\nStep up to LastPass Premium,\n\n23\n00:00:43,247 --> 00:00:45,194\nwhich I've had for like four years now,\n\n24\n00:00:45,194 --> 00:00:47,685\nand you get better two-factor\nauthentication options,\n\n25\n00:00:47,685 --> 00:00:49,726\nthe ability to easily\nshare out your logins,\n\n26\n00:00:49,726 --> 00:00:51,044\nand it's only like two bucks a month.\n\n27\n00:00:51,044 --> 00:00:52,593\nBest of all, it works basically across\n\n28\n00:00:52,593 --> 00:00:53,743\nall of your different devices,\n\n29\n00:00:53,743 --> 00:00:56,705\nwhether it be phone,\ntablet, computer, whatever.\n\n30\n00:00:56,705 --> 00:00:58,250\nSo, LastPass is legitimately something\n\n31\n00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,800\nthat I use every single day,\n\n32\n00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,989\nso if you guys wanna give it a try\n\n33\n00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:02,642\nand help support the channel,\nthe link to check it out\n\n34\n00:01:02,642 --> 00:01:04,280\nwill be in the description of this video.\n\n35\n00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,362\nWhen it comes to getting hacked,\n\n36\n00:01:05,362 --> 00:01:07,396\nthere are a lot of ways\nthat it can happen.\n\n37\n00:01:07,396 --> 00:01:08,477\nSo, maybe it's something simple\n\n38\n00:01:08,477 --> 00:01:10,839\nlike you open a fishy email attachment,\n\n39\n00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:11,672\nyou're visiting a site\n\n40\n00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,356\nthat you probably shouldn't be looking at.\n\n41\n00:01:13,356 --> 00:01:14,990\nRecently though, these hacks have become\n\n42\n00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,592\nmuch, much more ambitious.\n\n43\n00:01:16,592 --> 00:01:18,251\nSo, take for example Equifax.\n\n44\n00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:19,475\nThis is the credit agency\n\n45\n00:01:19,475 --> 00:01:23,108\nthat recently had 143 million\npeople's information leaked.\n\n46\n00:01:23,108 --> 00:01:24,374\nAnd this isn't small stuff\n\n47\n00:01:24,374 --> 00:01:25,961\nlike your phone number or address,\n\n48\n00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,563\nthis is really important information\n\n49\n00:01:27,563 --> 00:01:28,795\nlike your Social Security number,\n\n50\n00:01:28,795 --> 00:01:31,491\nwhich makes it very, very easy\nfor identity theft to happen.\n\n51\n00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,130\n- With growing fallout this morning\n\n52\n00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,662\nover its massive data breach.\n\n53\n00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:37,176\n- The biggest and most significant yet.\n\n54\n00:01:37,176 --> 00:01:41,007\n- Possibly putting 143\nmillion Americans at risk.\n\n55\n00:01:41,007 --> 00:01:42,744\n- So, back in March, a major vulnerability\n\n56\n00:01:42,744 --> 00:01:44,575\nwas found in Equifax's backend\n\n57\n00:01:44,575 --> 00:01:46,823\nand it wasn't fixed until the end of July,\n\n58\n00:01:46,823 --> 00:01:47,783\nmeaning that for months\n\n59\n00:01:47,783 --> 00:01:50,178\nabout one-third of the US\npopulation's information\n\n60\n00:01:50,178 --> 00:01:51,525\nwas wide open for the taking.\n\n61\n00:01:51,525 --> 00:01:53,496\nThis is hardly an isolated incident.\n\n62\n00:01:53,496 --> 00:01:55,529\nSo, only a few weeks\nafter the Equifax hack,\n\n63\n00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:57,615\nCCleaner had their own issues.\n\n64\n00:01:57,615 --> 00:01:59,850\nSo, CCleaner is a very popular utility\n\n65\n00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,664\nto allow you to clean your computer.\n\n66\n00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:03,251\nHowever, for a short time,\n\n67\n00:02:03,251 --> 00:02:04,771\nthe legitimate version was replaced\n\n68\n00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:06,284\nthat you downloaded from their site\n\n69\n00:02:06,284 --> 00:02:07,936\nwith a version that was\nloaded with malware.\n\n70\n00:02:07,936 --> 00:02:09,132\nThe scary part of this is\n\n71\n00:02:09,132 --> 00:02:11,084\nis that there was actually\nno real way of telling\n\n72\n00:02:11,084 --> 00:02:13,114\nthat what you were downloading\nwas actually malware\n\n73\n00:02:13,114 --> 00:02:14,819\nand not the proper program.\n\n74\n00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,112\nYou're going to the official\nsite, you're downloading it,\n\n75\n00:02:17,112 --> 00:02:19,340\ninstalling it, everything\nlooks completely legit\n\n76\n00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,656\nand the program even works.\n\n77\n00:02:20,656 --> 00:02:23,847\nHowever, in the background\nwas a serious virus.\n\n78\n00:02:23,847 --> 00:02:25,796\nSo, the popular DVD ripping tool HandBrake\n\n79\n00:02:25,796 --> 00:02:27,546\nhad a very similar thing happen.\n\n80\n00:02:27,546 --> 00:02:29,142\nFor a period of four days,\n\n81\n00:02:29,142 --> 00:02:31,217\nthe legitimate download\nwas replaced with a version\n\n82\n00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:33,965\nthat had a Mac-specific version\nof malware inside of it.\n\n83\n00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:35,061\nEven worse is that hacks\n\n84\n00:02:35,061 --> 00:02:37,091\nare no longer confined to just software;\n\n85\n00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:39,283\nthey're hitting close to home, literally.\n\n86\n00:02:39,283 --> 00:02:41,332\nWith products like Amazon\nEcho and Google Home\n\n87\n00:02:41,332 --> 00:02:43,189\nbeing brought into more\nand more households,\n\n88\n00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:45,017\nthese companies are\ngetting closer and closer\n\n89\n00:02:45,017 --> 00:02:46,758\nto our personal lives than ever before.\n\n90\n00:02:46,758 --> 00:02:48,438\nNow, this can be a good thing.\n\n91\n00:02:48,438 --> 00:02:50,122\nSo, it's nice to be able\nto walk into your house\n\n92\n00:02:50,122 --> 00:02:52,190\nand tell Alexa to turn the lights on.\n\n93\n00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,000\nMaybe if you forget to look\nyour door when you leave,\n\n94\n00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,199\nyou can just do it\nstraight from your phone\n\n95\n00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,288\nwith a smart lock.\n\n96\n00:02:56,288 --> 00:02:57,694\nAnd stuff like Nest security cameras\n\n97\n00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:59,305\nwill give you a much\nbetter sense of security\n\n98\n00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:01,807\nwhen you can see exactly what's\ngoing on inside your house.\n\n99\n00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,229\nBut like all good things in life,\n\n100\n00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:05,403\nit doesn't exactly work all the time.\n\n101\n00:03:05,403 --> 00:03:06,495\nAnd like a lot of people fear\n\n102\n00:03:06,495 --> 00:03:08,676\nwhen stuff like the Amazon\nEcho first came out,\n\n103\n00:03:08,676 --> 00:03:10,432\nthere is a way to now hack this.\n\n104\n00:03:10,432 --> 00:03:11,920\nIf you peel back the little rubber pad\n\n105\n00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,306\non the bottom of an Amazon Echo,\n\n106\n00:03:13,306 --> 00:03:15,227\nyou'll see a series of contacts.\n\n107\n00:03:15,227 --> 00:03:16,153\nSo, using these,\n\n108\n00:03:16,153 --> 00:03:17,356\nif you have a little bit\nof technical knowledge\n\n109\n00:03:17,356 --> 00:03:19,882\nand about 10 minutes, you can\nactually turn an Amazon Echo\n\n110\n00:03:19,882 --> 00:03:21,115\ninto a listening device.\n\n111\n00:03:21,115 --> 00:03:21,948\nThe upside is,\n\n112\n00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:24,072\nas long as you don't have\na super-nerd as an enemy,\n\n113\n00:03:24,072 --> 00:03:25,924\nthis is not an easy hack to pull off.\n\n114\n00:03:25,924 --> 00:03:27,749\nNot only do you need\nthat technical knowledge\n\n115\n00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:31,074\nbut you also need to have actual\naccess to the Echo in-hand.\n\n116\n00:03:31,074 --> 00:03:31,939\nAnd to Amazon's credit,\n\n117\n00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:33,543\nthey actually have\nremoved this vulnerability\n\n118\n00:03:33,543 --> 00:03:34,795\nfrom the most recent model.\n\n119\n00:03:34,795 --> 00:03:35,684\nThe real issue here\n\n120\n00:03:35,684 --> 00:03:37,622\nis when there's an Echo in a public place.\n\n121\n00:03:37,622 --> 00:03:39,907\nSo, take for example the\nWynn hotel in Las Vegas.\n\n122\n00:03:39,907 --> 00:03:41,657\nThey have an Echo in every single room,\n\n123\n00:03:41,657 --> 00:03:43,311\nand all it takes is for\nsomeone to hack it once\n\n124\n00:03:43,311 --> 00:03:44,818\nand they can listen in\nto the conversations\n\n125\n00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:46,402\nin that room pretty much forever.\n\n126\n00:03:46,402 --> 00:03:49,307\nAll right, so what can you\nactually do about this?\n\n127\n00:03:49,307 --> 00:03:50,582\nWell, the first thing to understand\n\n128\n00:03:50,582 --> 00:03:51,848\nis that there's no way of keeping you\n\n129\n00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:53,591\nand your data completely safe.\n\n130\n00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:55,578\nIf you applied for a\ncredit card five years ago\n\n131\n00:03:55,578 --> 00:03:58,012\nand the credit agency\ngets hacked, too bad.\n\n132\n00:03:58,012 --> 00:03:59,219\nI'm probably never going to know\n\n133\n00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:01,281\nhow my credit card got compromised.\n\n134\n00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:02,424\nIt could've been something simple\n\n135\n00:04:02,424 --> 00:04:04,840\nlike being skimmed at\nan ATM or gas station\n\n136\n00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,975\nor maybe some site that I\nused the card on was hacked\n\n137\n00:04:06,975 --> 00:04:08,289\nand I just didn't know it.\n\n138\n00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,581\nBut there are some things you can do\n\n139\n00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:10,671\nto help protect yourself.\n\n140\n00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:13,100\nThe easiest thing is to\njust check your credit.\n\n141\n00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,105\nSo, if you live in the\nUS, federal law guarantees\n\n142\n00:04:15,105 --> 00:04:16,725\nthat you can get one free credit report\n\n143\n00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:18,943\nfrom each of the three\nmajor agencies per year.\n\n144\n00:04:18,943 --> 00:04:20,581\nOn the digital front,\nit makes sense to have\n\n145\n00:04:20,581 --> 00:04:24,012\nsome kind of antivirus and\nkeep your devices up-to-date.\n\n146\n00:04:24,012 --> 00:04:25,585\nSo, that includes those Windows updates\n\n147\n00:04:25,585 --> 00:04:27,899\nthat you've been saying no\nto for the last six months\n\n148\n00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:30,026\nor you keep your browser\nup to date, your phone;\n\n149\n00:04:30,026 --> 00:04:32,395\nall of these things are constantly\ngetting security updates\n\n150\n00:04:32,395 --> 00:04:34,515\nand they can really save you\nwhen these things come up.\n\n151\n00:04:34,515 --> 00:04:36,326\nThreats like this are\nnever going to go away.\n\n152\n00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:38,260\nBut as long as you're smart\nand keep an eye on things,\n\n153\n00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,877\nthen you should be fine.\n\n154\n00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:42,323\nSo, have you actually ever\ngotten hacked yourself?\n\n155\n00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,555\nLet me know in the comments below,\n\n156\n00:04:43,555 --> 00:04:45,230\nand I will catch you in the next one.\n\n"
